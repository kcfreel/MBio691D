Going through genomes SAR11 (HIMB123 and HIMB109) 

We’ve already made nextera libraries from 200ul of each culture.  In adition, we’re also planning to do MDA on cells harvested from a different aliquot of 200ul.  We didn’t talk about this initially, but thought it was worth giving a shot.  We’ll run them all together.  That being said, ti will still be a few weeks before we get data.  My group can move sample through queue quickly by bypassin certain steps, but we can’t cut straight to the front of the line.


Hi Mik and Kelle,

I’m trying to figure out best way to share data with you, but I can tell you that the genomes looked better when we did MDA from a few thousand cells rather than going directly to nextera without prior amplification.  In some cases I think we’re getting the nearly the entire genome, but as with illumina assemblies they tend to be in ~100 contigs.  

The deadline for small scale CSP is Sept 5, but the application is much smaller than regular CSP.  Check out link below.  This could be a good way to get officially started on the project.  IF accepted, we could talk more about technical strategy, e.g. improving direct to nexter vs MDA.
